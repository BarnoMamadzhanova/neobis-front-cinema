## **Overview**

### This project aims to create a dynamic movie poster application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Kinopoisk Unofficial API. The application will display movie posters categorized into sections such as "Premieres of the Current Month," "Top Expected Movies," "Top Best Movies," "Digital Releases of the Current Month," and "Favorites." Users can save their favorite movies using local storage.
